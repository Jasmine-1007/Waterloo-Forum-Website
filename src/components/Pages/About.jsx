   <p>Foster Civil Yet Robust Debate on Campus</p>
<h1 className="about-title">About Us</h1>
<p className="about-content">"What’s the Waterloo Forum?"
 
We're a student-led initiative—supported by the Office of Research—dedicated to building a culture of open dialogue, critical thinking, and diversity of thought on campus. 
 
It is our hope that through public debate will come individual reflection.
 
We're not a fight club.
 
Ideologies are not sports teams to cheer for—or debaters, fighters in a ring. 
 
We’re not sitting on the edge of our seats waiting for one expert to crush the other. If that’s what you’re after, buy an MMA streaming subscription.
 
We believe in respectful discourse. The stuff of deep thinkers who accept the challenge to re-evaluate their own beliefs and humbly question others.
 
The loudest voice doesn’t win.
 
If that were the case, we’d just have someone stand behind the microphone and read you the year’s most-liked posts from X or LinkedIn.
 
But the loudest voices are often the most intellectually insecure.
 
Let’s hear from the quiet voices, the ones confident enough not to overcompensate with volume.
 
We’re just getting started.
Each term, we will host a series of debates—open to anyone on campus to attend. Open to you.
 
We're excited for the year ahead.

Thank you for being remarkable,
